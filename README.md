# Call for Coders® Challenges
Every business has an impact on society and the way that people live their lives, from the products and services they deliver—whether food, mobile communications, banking services, or utilities—to the way they operate—including employment practices and value chain decisions.

We originally created these challenges designed specifically to address the needs of tech entrepreneurs across several different industries and technologies.

## Social Responsibility
Organisations and institutions must adopt integrated approaches to social responsibility and sustainability to create value so stockholders can help mitigate risks, reduce costs, build brand value, and identify new market opportunities. 
Blockchain provides traceability and accountability for every transaction within the social economy, and with additional features like smart contracts, aims to operate free from human interferences and the risk of corruption.
Trustless cooperation tools might be a good example for applications over distributed infrastructures, but we can also find blockchain solutions applied to customs declarations.
- Institutions and policy makers
- Connected citizens
- Collaborative environments

## Global Resources Distribution
Innovative and multi-beneficial approaches to the complex social, economic and ecological challenges of our times can be revealed by measuring and monitoring the way we extract, use and dispose of our natural resources.
For the past few years, research and development to enhance food authenticity and food safety have been dramatically improved.
Through the practice of precision agriculture to measure the usability of fertilizers, seeds, water and get a deeper overview of local weather patterns provided accurate cultivation, harvesting and land treatments.
Ai, Machine Learning and decentralised technologies - closely coupled with connected devices such as drones, smartphones and cameras - can bring a new level of traceability of food products to their source.
- Safety
- Waste
- Production

## Autonomous Systems
Our vision of an autonomous future is to connect today's technologies to tomorrow's vision.
Cars and drones can through decentralized systems, communicate with each other and external services for charging, deliveries and maintenance.
By using peer-to-peer protocols that do not rely on any central server but on a network of nodes, we can imagine multiple deployments to secure - and protect - the users, the drivers and the providers.
- Smart transportation
- Energy consumption
- Security and protection

## Non-profit Management
Non-profit management systems run on centralized approaches meaning single-entity control equivalent to a single point of failure, which makes most donation environments extremely vulnerable to hacker attacks and even power outages.
By deploying improved systems, utilizing peer-to-peer approaches, with no controlling authority being involved, non profit systems can formalize their commitment in a smart way and bring donation systems to the next level.
- Primary resource distribution
- Donations
- New trading assets

## Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging for All
We are committed to gender diversity, namely realizing the Anita Borg vision of 50-50 by 2020. We therefore wish to use technology itself to change the status of women in technology. 
Women face many challenges in the workplace, from equal-pay-for-equal work to various forms of harassment. Equal pay for equal work means that for the same: skill, effort, responsibility, working conditions in an establishment men and women are entitled to equal pay. Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.
